                        I'm a bilingual Colombian-American with a passion for
                        coding, gaming, snowboarding, climbing, and TV/films.
                        Skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, C, C#,
                        and have dabbled in Unity and RStudio. I have experience
                        with both relational and non-relational databases and
                        favor the MERN tech stack. My past projects and
                        experiences lean more towards front-end development, but
                        I'm fully capable of developing back-end and APIs. I'm
                        an eager learner keen on becoming a Software Engineer in
                        the tech industry, aiming to evolve into a Full Stack
                        Software Engineer.
