## Summary of Project

### Project Idea:

The objective of this is to create an interactive website application to showcase my personal portfolio of projects and tell a bit about myself.

### Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to practice, improve, and showcase my MERN stack development capabilities, while also showcasing my portfolio of projects.

### Planning:

-   **Front-End Development:** The front-end user interface will be designed using React and styled using CSS. I will uphold ES6 best practices to provide the user with an intuitive and enjoyable character building experience.
-   **Back-End Development:** The back-end will consist of a MongoDB that will be integrated using Node.js and Express.js. I will be creating a custom Node.js API, fit with suitable endpoints that will make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to and from my MongoDB.
-   **Hosting:** TBD

### Functionality

The portfolio website will give users a way to learn about me, interact with all my projects from a central website, and understand my capabilities and qualifications.
